# Description 
Discussion Network is a social media application designed to facilitate engaging and structured discussions among users. It allows users to create posts, interact with others by agreeing, disagreeing, or reposting, and build their profiles. The application features a dynamic feed where posts are displayed differently based on the context—showing all posts on the homepage while limiting the profile page to only the user’s own content, with the ability to delete personal posts. Built using Java and Swing, the application uses multiple design patterns. With a focus on intuitive design and seamless interaction, Discussion Network provides a platform for users to express opinions, engage in meaningful conversations, and navigate discussions effortlessly.
